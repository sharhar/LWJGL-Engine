# LWJGL 2D Engine

This repo is an eclipse workspace, so if you would like to run it then you have to create an eclipse workspace in the directory of the repo. Once you do that you need to add the projects by creating a new java project with the exact same name. Then go to the projects that need openGL and add the respective lwjgl.jar and naitives for you particular project and OS.

Currently there are three projects in the making, the original engine (ludumdaregame), a sprite creation gui for the original engine (spritecreationgui), and a new engine built with openGL 3.0+ and LWJGL3 (enginewithadvancedopengl).
